# portfolio

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.
   - Build my portfolio by following Swedish guidelines for accessibility and how to build websites for everyone.

The problem
Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
   - I need to add outer and innerWrapper for my sections with specific codes that can be used for the whole projects instead of adding codes for each one of sections and div. 
   - I still need to figure out how I can centered the topics and why my Featured Projects section cannot show just 2 images in desktop media query. I think I need to add more DIVs in my sections in order to have seperate boxes to work with. My problem is when I change title then I see the same change on my other codes under same section.
   - Need to figure out why Tab doesn't work in some title and sections in my page without using Tabindex.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
