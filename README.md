# portfolio

// Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.
   - Build my portfolio by following Swedish guidelines for accessibility and how to build websites for everyone.

// The problem
Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

---- If I had more time:

   - I need to add outer and innerWrapper for my sections with specific codes that can be used for the whole projects instead of adding codes for each one of sections and div. 

   - I could centered my titles by removing width and height.

   - The hovers work for the whole Featured project and not just for the pictures. Need to find the problem. 

   - Need to figure out why Tab doesn't work in some title and sections in my page without using Tabindex.
